Game Grid
=========

Custom grid layout for dynamically sized elements.

## _NOTE:_ This is a work in progress. No guarantees are expressed or implied as to useability, functionality, or even practicality.
In other words...be cool man.

###Usage
For now Game Grid has a hard dependency on `Modernizr.prefixed()` to normalize vendor prefixing of the 'transform' property. Ensure a build of [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) including the _prefixed_ (see [this](http://modernizr.com/download/#-backgroundsize-opacity-cssanimations-csstransforms-csstransforms3d-csstransitions-shiv-cssclasses-prefixed-teststyles-testprop-testallprops-prefixes-domprefixes) ) option is initiated prior to Game Grid.


### To-do:
Write out clear and full documentation
