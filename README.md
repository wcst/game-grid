Game Grid
=========

Custom grid layout for dynamically sized elements.

## _NOTE:_ This is a work in progress. No guarantees are expressed or implied as to useability, functionality, or even practicality.
In other words...be cool man.

###Usage

####Dependencies
Game Grid carries two hard dependencies: 
  - [`Modernizr.prefixed`](http://modernizr.com/docs/#prefixed) – to normalize vendor prefixing of the 'transform' property. Ensure a build of [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com) including the _prefixed_ option (seen [here](http://modernizr.com/download/#-backgroundsize-opacity-cssanimations-csstransforms-csstransforms3d-csstransitions-shiv-cssclasses-prefixed-teststyles-testprop-testallprops-prefixes-domprefixes)) is initiated prior to Game Grid.
  
  - [`EndPool.js`](https://github.com/wcst/end-pool) – needed to listen for multiple `transitionEnd` events;


### To-do:
  - Write out clear and full documentation
  - Add examples
